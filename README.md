# ClosestPoints
A divide and conquer algorithm that finds the two closest Vermont public schools.
The data was collected at: https://geodata.vermont.gov/#data 

This algorithm is a practical implementation of the divide and conquer paradigm. It is a java implementation using array lists to store each school object. Each school is initialized with an x and y coordinate attribute, thus being treated as a point on a map. 

The data provided could easily be modified to complete the closest point algorithm for any other data set containing objects with euclidian locations.
